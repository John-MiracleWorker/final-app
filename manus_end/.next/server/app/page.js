This is also the area where one\\nbegins the initial portion of the doffing process (following a full suit wipe down within the hot zone) when leaving the\\nhot zone.

It is used for the transport of highly infectious\\ndisease patients either internally at a facility or from one facility to another.\\n1.  Patient will be transported in impervious suit if ambulatory, in impervious suit and sheets (as\\ntolerated) if stretcher bound or in isolation pod, as indicated.  All transferred patient\\nbelongings are considered contaminated and are typically bagged, labeled, and transferred\\nwith patient.\\n2.  Any patient care documents should be free of contamination. When in doubt, consider them\\ncontaminated and package as appropriate for transport with patient. It may be desirable to\\nstore and transmit patient care records electronically if feasible.\\nIndications for use:\\n1.  A known or suspected case of highly infectious disease that may have been acquired via\\ntravel, health care provider, or lab.\\n2.  Drug resistant organism\\n3.  Some Medical Isolation Transport Devices may be used as a positive air environment to\\ntransport a patient with known immune deficiency or burns.\\nThings to know regarding use of Medical Isolation Transport Device:\\n1.  Assess if MEDICAL ISOLATION TRANSPORT DEVICE outside straps are approved for\\n2.\\ntransportation.  General rule:  vinyl straps are not tested and approved, but some material\\nstraps (such as those used in seat belts) may have been tested and approved.\\nThe head of the Medical Isolation Transport Device should be placed at the head of the\\ngurney or cart, so the patient is always moving feet first.\\nThe white noise created by the blower motor will reduce patient and staff level of hearing.\\n3.\\n4.  Be careful that wind may catch and move the Medical Isolation Transport Device, especially\\nwhen unsecured.\\n5.  As the outside temperature increases, the temperature inside the Medical Isolation\\nTransport Device will also increase.\\n6.  After using the Medical Isolation Transport Device during a drill, it may be cleaned and\\ndisinfected for future use.  Some disinfectants may leave a residue that can be wiped off\\nwith a clean towel.","source_file":"10.16-SPRN-Medical-Isolation-Transport-Device-7.23.23.txt","categories":["medical"]},"10-17":{"name":"TEAM SELECTION PROCEDURE","content":"☐ Medical Control Authorities choosing to adopt this supplement may do so\\nby selecting this check box.

An on-scene physician must identify themself and verify to Medical Control either\\nthe fact of an established physician-patient relationship with the patient, or\\nwillingness to assume responsibility for the patient and to accompany the patient to\\nthe hospital.

A physician on-scene may participate with paramedic(s) in the resuscitation of a\\npatient with permission of Medical Control without assuming full responsibility for\\nthe patient. This responsibility will, in this case, remain with the Medical Control\\nphysician and the ALS system.\\n5. It should be noted that responsibility for the patient at the scene rests with the online medical control physician. Decisions releasing medical care responsibility to\\nanother physician should be considered carefully.\\n6. If an on-scene health care professional has identified themself, and obstructs\\nefforts of the paramedic(s) to aid a patient for whom they are called, or who insists\\non rendering patient care inconsistent with the system standards and resists all\\ninvitation to function appropriately to the point where his continued intervention will\\nresult in obstruction to rendering good and reasonable patient care, EMS personnel\\nshould:\\na. Request Public Safety Officers become involved, if necessary, so that the team\\nmembers can continue to provide patient care according to system protocol.\\nb.

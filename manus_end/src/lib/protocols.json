The process describes the measures needed to clean and disinfect an\nambulance prior to its return to service following the transport of a patient with a known or\nsuspected Category A disease.\nNote: All disinfection should use a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered\nhospital disinfectant with a label claim for a non-enveloped virus (norovirus, rotavirus,\nadenovirus, poliovirus) to disinfect environmental surfaces at appropriate concentration and\ncontact time.\n1. This process is to be done after the Biocell or visquine (see procedure) has been\nremoved.\n2. Site Set Up\nA. Select an appropriate site for ambulance decontamination that protects the\nvehicle and the decontamination team from weather elements, preferably a well-\nventilated large, enclosed structure.\nB. Establish a secure perimeter for safety of the public and decontamination\npersonnel.\nC. Include considerations for waste management, security plan, public perception,\nand media visibility when selecting decontamination site.\nD. Depending on the location, the ability for climate control is beneficial.\nE. Define and mark hot, warm, and cold zones of contamination1 around the\nambulance that require PPE to enter.\n1 The hot zone is considered an area that is known or suspected to be contaminated and has a high risk of exposure. It\nshould only be entered with full PPE. In ambulance decontamination, this would be the vehicle and an area about a\nmeter beyond the ambulance.\nThe warm zone can be considered a transitional area between the hot and cold zones that has no known contamination\nbut has a moderate risk of exposure. It should only be entered when wearing full PPE. This is also the area where one\nbegins the initial portion of the doffing process (following a full suit wipe down within the hot zone) when leaving the\nhot zone. For ambulance decontamination, the warm zone can also be the place where waste barrels are pre-positioned\nso that the waste bags can be placed directly into the containers without entering the hot zone.",

This protocol will only\nbe used by SPRN trained individuals.\nMedical Isolation Transport Device\nDefinition:  A Medical Isolation Transport Device is a vinyl enclosed patient containment device.\nIt creates a negative air environment when closed.   It is used for the transport of highly infectious\ndisease patients either internally at a facility or from one facility to another.\n1.  Patient will be transported in impervious suit if ambulatory, in impervious suit and sheets (as\ntolerated) if stretcher bound or in isolation pod, as indicated.  All transferred patient\nbelongings are considered contaminated and are typically bagged, labeled, and transferred\nwith patient.\n2.  Any patient care documents should be free of contamination. When in doubt, consider them\ncontaminated and package as appropriate for transport with patient. It may be desirable to\nstore and transmit patient care records electronically if feasible.\nIndications for use:\n1.  A known or suspected case of highly infectious disease that may have been acquired via\ntravel, health care provider, or lab.\n2.  Drug resistant organism\n3.  Some Medical Isolation Transport Devices may be used as a positive air environment to\ntransport a patient with known immune deficiency or burns.\nThings to know regarding use of Medical Isolation Transport Device:\n1.  Assess if MEDICAL ISOLATION TRANSPORT DEVICE outside straps are approved for\n2.\ntransportation.  General rule:  vinyl straps are not tested and approved, but some material\nstraps (such as those used in seat belts) may have been tested and approved.\nThe head of the Medical Isolation Transport Device should be placed at the head of the\ngurney or cart, so the patient is always moving feet first.\nThe white noise created by the blower motor will reduce patient and staff level of hearing.\n3.\n4.  Be careful that wind may catch and move the Medical Isolation Transport Device, especially\nwhen unsecured.\n5.  As the outside temperature increases, the temperature inside the Medical Isolation\nTransport Device will also increase.\n6.  After using the Medical Isolation Transport Device during a drill, it may be cleaned and\ndisinfected for future use.  Some disinfectants may leave a residue that can be wiped off\nwith a clean towel.",

All agencies should frequently check the\nCDC.gov website for the latest recommendations with Personal Protective\nEquipment (PPE) and treatment. These recommendations may change frequently\nduring an evolving and ongoing epidemic/pandemic as regulatory standards are\ninfluenced by CDC recommendations.\n2. The center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared that an epidemic\nand/or the Michigan Department of Public Health has declared a statewide or local\npublic health emergency.\n3. \u201cAcute Febrile Respiratory Illness\u201d (AFRI) is defined as fever and at least one of the\nfollowing (cough, nasal congestion/runny nose, or sore throat).\nEMS System / Medical Control Authority (MCA) Recommendations:\n1. Encourage all EMS personnel to receive seasonal and disease specific\nvaccinations.\n2. Each life support agency shall maintain a supply of fit tested N-95 respirators and\neye protection (e.g., goggles, eye shield), disposable non-sterile gloves, and gowns.\n3. Each life support agency shall provide approved pathogen neutralizing hand\nsanitizer to staff.\n4. Each life support agency should instruct their personnel to stay home and not report\nfor duty if they have signs or symptoms of acute febrile respiratory illness. A staff\nmember that develops these symptoms during a shift must inform the agency\nsupervisor for appropriate follow up procedures.\n5. Dispatch centers should be encouraged to screen callers to determine if the patient\n6.\nmay have an AFRI. Information should be provided to EMS personnel prior to\narriving on the scene if suspected AFRI.\nIf it is determined by EMS that the patient may have an AFRI, early notification to\nthe receiving facility should be done so that appropriate infection control may be\ntaken prior to patient arrival.\nProcedure and Patient Categorizations/Situations\n1. Limiting Personnel Exposure:\nA. If the patient has symptoms of an \u201cAcute Febrile Respiratory Illness\u201d (AFRI)\nbased upon the dispatch information the responding agency should consider\nlimiting the initial number of personnel that approach or enter a residence.",

    "content": "Head Injury \u2013 Moderate & Severe TBI\nPurpose:  Reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with Traumatic Brain Injury\n(TBI). The treatment of a patient with suspected TBI should focus on four important clinically\nidentifiable conditions: hypoxia, hyperventilation, hypotension, and hemorrhage.  Overall\napproach:  Continuous monitoring of O2 saturation with high-flow oxygen regardless of O2\nsaturation, avoidance of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) whenever possible and use of\ncontinuous quantitative end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) monitoring in patients requiring positive\npressure ventilation, blood pressure monitoring every 3-5 minutes and using IV fluids to\nmaintain BP above target, and assessment for signs of hemorrhage or hemorrhagic shock\nwith use of applicable bleeding control interventions.\nI.  TBI Criteria (moderate or severe TBI)\n1.  Anyone with physical trauma and a mechanism consistent for a brain injury AND\none or more of the following:\na.  Any loss of consciousness OR any altered mental status (e.g., GCS <15)\nb.  Multisystem trauma requiring PPV, whether the primary need for PPV was from\nTBI or from other injuries.\nc.  Seizures: pre-traumatic or post-traumatic seizures whether continuing or not.\nd.  In infants (where mental status may be difficult to interpret): any decreased\nlevel of consciousness or decreased responsiveness.\nII.   Procedure:\n1. Follow 1.1 General Pre-hospital Care Protocol\n2. Transport according to 8.3 Transportation Protocol.\n3. Manage Airway & Oxygenation (Prevent Hypoxemia)\n  a. All patients identified with moderate or severe head injury should receive\ncontinuous high-flow oxygen immediately by non-rebreather mask.\nb. Monitor and maintain SpO2 equal to or greater than 90%.\nc. If hypoxia is present despite high-flow oxygen, basic maneuvers for airway\nrepositioning should be attempted, followed by reevaluation.\n  d. If this does not restore SpO2 to 90% or greater, or if there is inadequate\nventilatory effort, bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation should be performed, 2-\nperson with supplemental oxygen and basic airway adjuncts.\ne. Advanced airway placement only when BVM ventilation ineffective or other\nconditions warrant advanced airway (e.g., long transport time) refer to 7.9\nAirway Management-Procedure Protocol\n4. Manage Ventilation (Prevent Hyperventilation)\nNote:  Identify and treat hypoventilation as well as prevent hyperventilation when\nassisting ventilation.  As much as possible maintain normal ventilation.  Hyper-\nventilation decreases cerebral blood flow and worsens secondary brain injury.\nStrict attention on avoiding hypo- and hyper- ventilation is critical. It has been\nshown that repeatedly that inadvertent hyperventilation happens reliably if not\nmeticulously prevented.  Use Pressure-Controlled Bags (PCBs) and Ventilation",

The primary purpose is protection of the patient from further harm. Do not\nconfront the patient or family members with such suspicions at the scene.\nMichigan law (MCL 722.623) requires that licensed EMS providers who have \u201creasonable\ncause to suspect child abuse or neglect\u201d shall report \u201cimmediately, by telephone or\notherwise\u201d their suspicions to the Protective Services Agency for the County involved. In\ncases of suspected child abuse, this oral report shall also be followed with a written report\non the Department of Human Services forms available in every hospital emergency\ndepartment.\nMichigan law (MCL 400.11a) also requires this same oral report for suspected cases of\nabuse or neglect of an adult.\nLicensed providers are required to make an immediate verbal report and a written report\nwithin 72 hours when they suspect child abuse or neglect. Mandated reporters must also\nnotify the head of their organization of the report. Reporting the suspected allegations of\nchild abuse and/or neglect to the head of the organization does not fulfill the requirement to\nreport directly to MDHHS.\nThe verbal report can be completed by calling 855-444-3911.

Patients with penetrating traumatic injuries do not require spinal precautions unless a\nfocal neurologic deficit is noted on the spinal injury assessment.\n5.  An ambulatory patient with a positive spinal injury assessment should have an\nappropriately sized cervical collar placed. Place the patient directly on the ambulance\ncot in a supine position or position with least amount of elevation to maintain comfort,\nlimiting movement of the spine during the process.\n6.

An amputation with hemorrhage does not\nnecessitate the use of a tourniquet; most bleeding from these injuries is controllable\nthrough use of direct pressure and elevation.\n2.  Amputation with uncontrolled active bleeding.\n3.  A mass causality incident may be an indication for the use of tourniquets for\ntemporary control of hemorrhage while the situation is brought under control.\nContraindications:\n1.  Never use a tourniquet for more than the recommended period of time (product-\nspecific).  With any extrication plus transport time of less than 180 minutes, there is\nminimal risk of developing an ischemic limb.\n2.  Never apply a tourniquet over an impaled object.\nProcedure:\n1.  If possible, check neurovascular status prior to tourniquet application (pulse,\nsensation, motor function distal to hemorrhage).\n2.  Apply tourniquet directly to the skin, proximal to the area of bleeding, at least 2-3\ninches (5-8 centimeters) from the wound margins.\n3.  Secure the tourniquet in place; continue to tighten the tourniquet until arterial\nocclusion (bleeding stops).\n4.  A successfully placed tourniquet may cause significant pain. (Refer to 7.13 Pain\nManagement-Procedure Protocol).\n5.  Document the time the tourniquet was applied.\n6.  Note  neurovascular status every five minutes post application.\n7.  Notify the receiving hospital that a tourniquet is in place.\n8.  Do not adjust or remove a tourniquet once bleeding is controlled.\n9.  A second tourniquet adjacent to the first may be necessary.\nNotes:\n1.  Tourniquets should not be applied over joints.  Application over the peroneal nerve\n(knee or ankle) or ulnar nerve (the elbow) may result in nerve damage or paralysis.\n2.  Any limb with an applied tourniquet should be fully exposed and the tourniquet should\nnot be covered with any other bandage.\n3.  Continued bleeding (other than medullary oozing from fractured bones) distal to the\nsite of the tourniquet is a sign of insufficient pressure and a need to tighten the\ntourniquet further.  A second tourniquet adjacent to the first may be necessary.  Refer\nto 2.13 Bleeding Control-Treatment Protocol.\n4.

For some of these patients this device is a\nbridge to transplant but for others it is a life prolonging therapy if transplant is not an option.\nCare of patients supported by these devices can present a challenge for care givers in the\npre-hospital environment. This document provides guidance for the provision of emergency\ncare for patients in the pre-hospital environment who have an LVAD in place.\nIf the information is not readily available, contact medical control for assistance.\n1.  LVAD\u2019s create non-pulsatile flow; it may be difficult to obtain vital signs using\nstandard equipment and or methods. Utilize skin color, mental status and capillary\nrefill to assess the patient.\n2.  The device supports left ventricular function and is dependent on some right heart\nfunction and adequate circulating volume. Even minor volume depletion may cause\ndiminished perfusion and require fluid administration.\n3.  All LVAD patients are anticoagulated.\n4.  LVAD\u2019s are powered electrically, a driveline exits the body, connects to a \u201ccontroller\u201d\nwhich in turn is connected to a power source. Proper functioning of the device is\ndependent on the integrity of these connections. Exercise caution related to the\ndrive line, which exits through the skin in the upper abdomen. Do not cut, pull or\ndamage it in any way. It will be secured by some type of binder or other device to\nprotect it.\n5.  Connections should not be forced together or apart. All connections are secured by\na locking device.\n6.  Generally, patients, their families and caregivers are familiar with the operation of\nthe device and should accompany the patient as a resource for operation of the\ndevice if promptly available.\n7.  All LVAD patients are assigned a hospital-based coordinator who is available by\nphone and should be contacted urgently.\n8.  All LVAD patients should have a \u201cgo bag\u201d close by which contains an additional\npower supply as well as an extra controller. This should be brought with the patient\nto the hospital. This should contain charged batteries, a back-up controller and a\npower-based unit.\n9.  If possible, the patient should be transported with four fully charged batteries.

Rationale: Medical history and examination cannot identify all patients infected\nwith bloodborne pathogens.\n3. Practice: Standard Precautions/BSI will be done for patient encounters in which\nthe risk of exposure to blood or body fluid exists.\nB. Respiratory Precautions\n1. Purpose: To prevent the transmission of airborne infections for patients with\nrespiratory complaints.\n2. Rationale: Medical history and examination cannot fully identify all patients with\ntransmissible respiratory pathogens. Respiratory complaints include but are not\nlimited to dyspnea, cough, shortness of breath, etc.\n3. Practice: Respiratory precautions will be used for every patient with respiratory\ncomplaints and/or receiving aerosolized treatments.\nC. Precautions for patients highly suspicious communicable disease including but\nnot limited to:\n1. Fever > 100.5 F with headache or malaise or myalgia, and cough or shortness of\nbreath or difficulty breathing.\n2. Pustular, papular or vesicular rash distributed over the body (trunk, face, arms, or\nlegs) preceded by fever with rash progressing over days (not weeks or months)\nand the patient appears ill.\na. Consider the patient to be both airborne and contact contagious.\nb. Crew PPE and procedures:\ni. N95 or higher protective mask/respiratory protection\nii. Goggles or face shield\niii. Gowns\niv.

Confirm entrance and procedure for transfer of patient into facility.\nii. Ensure proper notification and preparation of receiving facility for\ninter-facility transfers.\ne. Vehicles that have separate driver and patient compartments and can\nprovide separate ventilation to these areas are preferred for patient\ntransportation. If a vehicle without separate compartments and\nventilation must be used, the outside air vents in the driver\ncompartment should be turned on at the highest setting during\ntransport of patient to provide relative negative pressure in the patient\ncare compartment.\nf.\ng.\n\nDO NOT REMOVE protective equipment during patient transport.\nDiscourage non-essential personnel and family members from entry\nor accompanying patient in ambulance.\nh. Patient cohorting may occur if resources are exhausted and patients are\ngrouped with same disease. Cohorting should only be utilized as a last\nresort.\ni.\nThe ambulance(s)/transport vehicle will not be used to transport other\npatients (or for any other use) until it is decontaminated using the CDC\nguidelines for decontamination.\nD. Procedures\n1. Handwashing will be done before and after contact with ALL patients.\n2. Nonsterile disposable gloves will be worn with patients that pose a potential\nexposure through blood or body fluids. Gloves will be changed in-between\npatients and not used repeatedly.\n3.

    "content": ". It is ready to assume responsibility for patient care upon\nrequest of a physician who has initiated treatment of a patient with whom he has an\nestablished physician-patient relationship.\nThe EMS system On-Line Medical Control Physician is considered the highest medical\nauthority at the scene of a medical emergency with a patient unattended by a physician. An\non-scene physician who does not have an established physician-patient relationship and\nwishes to assume responsibility must seek permission from the Medical Control physician\nin order to do so.\nEMS Personnel are to receive orders for interfacility patient care from the referring\nphysician provided those orders are consistent with the training of the paramedic and the\n8.15 Interfacility Patient Transfer Protocol. If the patient\u2019s condition changes to the point\nthat the sending facilities orders did not meet the needs of the patient, the patient will\nbecome the responsibility of the EMS system. Appropriate treatment will be performed\nbased on the MCA protocols or from an on-line medical direction.\nProcedure:\nA. Physician\u2019s Office, Clinic or Ambulatory Patient Care Facility\n1. Physician Office, Clinic or Ambulatory Patient Care Facility to hospital transfers are\nconsidered scene calls unless a physician-to-physician transfer is designated by\nthe Physician Office, Clinic or Ambulatory Patient Care Facility. EMS personnel will\ntake responsibility for the patient as if the patient were coming from a prehospital\nscene.\n2. EMS personnel should obtain pertinent history, from the patient and physician (or\ndesignee).\na. If no destination is chosen, follow 8.3 Transport Protocol\nb. If physician to physician destination decision has been determined, honor that\nestablished agreement when possible.\ni. If a valid reason exists to not honor the established transport agreement,\ncontact Medical Control.\nB. Free Standing Emergency Department (FSED) to Hospital Transfers\n1. FSED is defined in the MCA Transport Protocol.\n2. A FSED to hospital transfer is considered a physician-to-physician interfacility\ntransfer.\n3. EMS personnel responding to a FSED should receive a patient report from the\ntreating physician (or designee). This report should include the physician\u2019s\nassessment, the requested destination, name of the person who accepted the\ntransfer, care to be given during transport, and any potential problems felt likely to\noccur in route.\n4. If EMS personnel do not agree with the destination or proposed orders, they\nshould discuss this with the transferring physician. If an agreement is not reached,\nmedical control should be contacted to determine the destination and care to be\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\nON-SCENE PHYSICIAN INTERACTION\nInitial Date: 9/14/2023\nRevised Date:",

At the discretion of the FSED physician, the FSED physician or designated facility\nstaff may treat and accompany the patient during transport with the assistance of\nthe EMS system.\n7. Upon departure from the scene, contact Medical Control as would be done for any\nEMS scene patient.\nC. Physician On-scene\n1. As time and patient condition permit, EMS personnel should make a reasonable\neffort to establish the identity or credentials of anyone at the scene of a medical\nemergency (not a covered by previous sections of this protocol) who professes to\nbe a Michigan licensed physician who expresses an interest in participating in\npatient care activities.\n2. An on-scene physician must identify themself and verify to Medical Control either\nthe fact of an established physician-patient relationship with the patient, or\nwillingness to assume responsibility for the patient and to accompany the patient to\nthe hospital. The Medical Control physician may allow the on-scene physician to\nprovide on-scene Medical Direction and then not accompany the patient to the\nhospital. Should this occur the Medical Control physician re-assumes responsibility\nfor the patient during transport.\n3. The Medical Control physician will verify over the radio his delegation of\nresponsibility to the physician on-scene and the nature of that delegation.\n4. A physician on-scene may participate with paramedic(s) in the resuscitation of a\npatient with permission of Medical Control without assuming full responsibility for\nthe patient. This responsibility will, in this case, remain with the Medical Control\nphysician and the ALS system.\n5. It should be noted that responsibility for the patient at the scene rests with the online medical control physician. Decisions releasing medical care responsibility to\nanother physician should be considered carefully.\n6. If an on-scene health care professional has identified themself, and obstructs\nefforts of the paramedic(s) to aid a patient for whom they are called, or who insists\non rendering patient care inconsistent with the system standards and resists all\ninvitation to function appropriately to the point where his continued intervention will\nresult in obstruction to rendering good and reasonable patient care, EMS personnel\nshould:\na. Request Public Safety Officers become involved, if necessary, so that the team\nmembers can continue to provide patient care according to system protocol.\nb. Communicate the situation promptly to On-Line Medical Control.\nc. Document the behavior of the on-scene health care professional on the patient\ncare record.\nC.

    "content": "88 of 2006 and Public Acts 232, 233, 234, and 235 or 2000,\nparents may surrender their newborn child to any hospital, fire department, police station, or\ncall 911 from any location and remain anonymous. This protocol outlines steps to be taken\nin this circumstance. *IMPORTANT* While there is opportunity for information\ngathering through forms, the surrendering parent has the option of remaining\ncompletely anonymous and disclosing no information.\nDefinitions\nNewborn: A child who a physician reasonably believes to be not more than 72 hours\nold.\nEmergency Service Provider (ESP): A uniformed or otherwise identified employee or\ncontractor of a fire department, hospital, or police station when such an individual is\ninside the premises and on duty. ESP also includes a paramedic or an emergency\nmedical technician (EMT) when either of those individuals is responding to a 9-1-1\nemergency call.\nSurrender: To leave a newborn with an emergency service provider without expressing\nan intent to return for the newborn.\nProcedures\n1. The surrender of the infant must occur inside the fire department, police station or in\nresponse to a 9-1-1 emergency call to paramedics or EMT.\n2. In the instance of a parent attempting to surrender a newborn to a staffed ambulance,\nnot on an emergency call, immediately notify dispatch and establish an emergency\ncall.\n3. To protect the parent\u2019s right to anonymity/confidentiality, the EMS agency responding\nto a 9\u20131\u20131 emergency call from a parent(s) wanting to surrender a newborn, should\nnot use the vehicle sirens or flashing lights.\n4. The firefighter, police officer, paramedic or EMT personnel cannot refuse to accept\nthe infant and must place the infant under temporary protective custody.\n5. Fire departments, police stations, paramedics and EMTs have statutory obligations\nunder the law, including:\na. Assume that the child is a newborn and take into temporary protective\ncustody.\nb. Ask surrendering person(s) if they are the biological parent(s). If they are not\nthe biological parent(s) the newborn cannot be surrendered under the Safe\nDelivery of Newborns law.\nc. Make a reasonable effort to inform the parent(s) that:\ni. By surrendering the newborn, the parent(s) is releasing the newborn to\na child placement agency to be placed for adoption.\nii. He or she has 28 days to petition the Circuit Court, Family Division to\nregain custody of the newborn.\n\n-~l,\n\u00a3DHHS I\nM\nMichigan Departmenl o, Health,HumanServices\n\nBureau of Emergency\nPreparedness, EMS\nand Systems of Care\n\nMichigan\nSYSTEM\nSAFE DELIVERY OF NEWBORNS\n\nInitial Date: 06/13/2017\nRevised Date: 12/27/2022",

In addition, to decrease medical errors related to\nmiscommunication between EMS and emergency department personnel.\nProcedure:\n1. Patient is brought into the designated room. EMS will give handoff report ONE\ntime, at the patient side, to appropriate hospital personnel.\n2. When patient requires emergent attention to airway, breathing, or circulation,\ntransfer of patient care may occur prior to the formal handoff report.\n3. Once an expeditious initial patient assessment is complete, a formal \u201cEMS\nTimeout\u201d handoff report will occur.\n4. EMS Timeout is called by the hospital team leader. Each facility is to identify\nwho has this task (Attending, Senior Resident, Charge Nurse, etc.)\nA. ALL participants in the room are expected to stop and listen to the\nEMS handoff report.\nB. ALL lifesaving interventions such as CPR, bag mask ventilation, etc.,\ncontinues.\n5. EMS delivers uninterrupted patient report, which should be no more than 30-45\nseconds, when appropriate.\n6. When EMS completes the handoff report, the EMS personnel will:\nA. Answer questions.\nB. A patient transfer of care signature is recommended*. If a signature is\nobtained, it will be from the hospital team lead, or appropriate\ndesignee. They will sign EMS patient care record (PCR) with legal\nsignature, including full name and credentials.\n7. Verbal EMS transfer of care report shall be treated as part of the health care\nrecord and must be professional, accurate, and consistent with information\nincluded in the final submitted EMS electronic, or written patient care report.\n8.

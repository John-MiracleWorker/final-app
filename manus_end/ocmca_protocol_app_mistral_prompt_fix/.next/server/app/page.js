Patient will be transported in impervious suit if ambulatory, in impervious suit and sheets (as\\ntolerated) if stretcher bound or in isolation pod, as indicated.  All transferred patient\\nbelongings are considered contaminated and are typically bagged, labeled, and transferred\\nwith patient.\\n2.  Any patient care documents should be free of contamination. When in doubt, consider them\\ncontaminated and package as appropriate for transport with patient. It may be desirable to\\nstore and transmit patient care records electronically if feasible.\\nIndications for use:\\n1.  A known or suspected case of highly infectious disease that may have been acquired via\\ntravel, health care provider, or lab.\\n2.  Drug resistant organism\\n3.  Some Medical Isolation Transport Devices may be used as a positive air environment to\\ntransport a patient with known immune deficiency or burns.\\nThings to know regarding use of Medical Isolation Transport Device:\\n1.  Assess if MEDICAL ISOLATION TRANSPORT DEVICE outside straps are approved for\\n2.\\ntransportation.  General rule:  vinyl straps are not tested and approved, but some material\\nstraps (such as those used in seat belts) may have been tested and approved.\\nThe head of the Medical Isolation Transport Device should be placed at the head of the\\ngurney or cart, so the patient is always moving feet first.\\nThe white noise created by the blower motor will reduce patient and staff level of hearing.\\n3.\\n4.  Be careful that wind may catch and move the Medical Isolation Transport Device, especially\\nwhen unsecured.\\n5.  As the outside temperature increases, the temperature inside the Medical Isolation\\nTransport Device will also increase.\\n6.  After using the Medical Isolation Transport Device during a drill, it may be cleaned and\\ndisinfected for future use.

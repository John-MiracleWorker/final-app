The process describes the measures needed to clean and disinfect an\nambulance prior to its return to service following the transport of a patient with a known or\nsuspected Category A disease.\nNote: All disinfection should use a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered\nhospital disinfectant with a label claim for a non-enveloped virus (norovirus, rotavirus,\nadenovirus, poliovirus) to disinfect environmental surfaces at appropriate concentration and\ncontact time.\n1. This process is to be done after the Biocell or visquine (see procedure) has been\nremoved.\n2. Site Set Up\nA. Select an appropriate site for ambulance decontamination that protects the\nvehicle and the decontamination team from weather elements, preferably a well-\nventilated large, enclosed structure.\nB. Establish a secure perimeter for safety of the public and decontamination\npersonnel.\nC. Include considerations for waste management, security plan, public perception,\nand media visibility when selecting decontamination site.\nD. Depending on the location, the ability for climate control is beneficial.\nE. Define and mark hot, warm, and cold zones of contamination1 around the\nambulance that require PPE to enter.\n1 The hot zone is considered an area that is known or suspected to be contaminated and has a high risk of exposure. It\nshould only be entered with full PPE. In ambulance decontamination, this would be the vehicle and an area about a\nmeter beyond the ambulance.\nThe warm zone can be considered a transitional area between the hot and cold zones that has no known contamination\nbut has a moderate risk of exposure. It should only be entered when wearing full PPE. This is also the area where one\nbegins the initial portion of the doffing process (following a full suit wipe down within the hot zone) when leaving the\nhot zone. For ambulance decontamination, the warm zone can also be the place where waste barrels are pre-positioned\nso that the waste bags can be placed directly into the containers without entering the hot zone.",

This protocol will only\nbe used by SPRN trained individuals.\nMedical Isolation Transport Device\nDefinition:  A Medical Isolation Transport Device is a vinyl enclosed patient containment device.\nIt creates a negative air environment when closed.   It is used for the transport of highly infectious\ndisease patients either internally at a facility or from one facility to another.\n1.  Patient will be transported in impervious suit if ambulatory, in impervious suit and sheets (as\ntolerated) if stretcher bound or in isolation pod, as indicated.  All transferred patient\nbelongings are considered contaminated and are typically bagged, labeled, and transferred\nwith patient.\n2.  Any patient care documents should be free of contamination. When in doubt, consider them\ncontaminated and package as appropriate for transport with patient. It may be desirable to\nstore and transmit patient care records electronically if feasible.\nIndications for use:\n1.  A known or suspected case of highly infectious disease that may have been acquired via\ntravel, health care provider, or lab.\n2.  Drug resistant organism\n3.  Some Medical Isolation Transport Devices may be used as a positive air environment to\ntransport a patient with known immune deficiency or burns.\nThings to know regarding use of Medical Isolation Transport Device:\n1.  Assess if MEDICAL ISOLATION TRANSPORT DEVICE outside straps are approved for\n2.\ntransportation.  General rule:  vinyl straps are not tested and approved, but some material\nstraps (such as those used in seat belts) may have been tested and approved.\nThe head of the Medical Isolation Transport Device should be placed at the head of the\ngurney or cart, so the patient is always moving feet first.\nThe white noise created by the blower motor will reduce patient and staff level of hearing.\n3.\n4.  Be careful that wind may catch and move the Medical Isolation Transport Device, especially\nwhen unsecured.\n5.  As the outside temperature increases, the temperature inside the Medical Isolation\nTransport Device will also increase.\n6.  After using the Medical Isolation Transport Device during a drill, it may be cleaned and\ndisinfected for future use.  Some disinfectants may leave a residue that can be wiped off\nwith a clean towel.",

        "content": "Head Injury \u2013 Moderate & Severe TBI\nPurpose:  Reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with Traumatic Brain Injury\n(TBI). The treatment of a patient with suspected TBI should focus on four important clinically\nidentifiable conditions: hypoxia, hyperventilation, hypotension, and hemorrhage.  Overall\napproach:  Continuous monitoring of O2 saturation with high-flow oxygen regardless of O2\nsaturation, avoidance of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) whenever possible and use of\ncontinuous quantitative end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) monitoring in patients requiring positive\npressure ventilation, blood pressure monitoring every 3-5 minutes and using IV fluids to\nmaintain BP above target, and assessment for signs of hemorrhage or hemorrhagic shock\nwith use of applicable bleeding control interventions.\nI.  TBI Criteria (moderate or severe TBI)\n1.  Anyone with physical trauma and a mechanism consistent for a brain injury AND\none or more of the following:\na.  Any loss of consciousness OR any altered mental status (e.g., GCS <15)\nb.  Multisystem trauma requiring PPV, whether the primary need for PPV was from\nTBI or from other injuries.\nc.  Seizures: pre-traumatic or post-traumatic seizures whether continuing or not.\nd.  In infants (where mental status may be difficult to interpret): any decreased\nlevel of consciousness or decreased responsiveness.\nII.   Procedure:\n1. Follow 1.1 General Pre-hospital Care Protocol\n2. Transport according to 8.3 Transportation Protocol.\n3. Manage Airway & Oxygenation (Prevent Hypoxemia)\n  a. All patients identified with moderate or severe head injury should receive\ncontinuous high-flow oxygen immediately by non-rebreather mask.\nb. Monitor and maintain SpO2 equal to or greater than 90%.\nc. If hypoxia is present despite high-flow oxygen, basic maneuvers for airway\nrepositioning should be attempted, followed by reevaluation.\n  d. If this does not restore SpO2 to 90% or greater, or if there is inadequate\nventilatory effort, bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation should be performed, 2-\nperson with supplemental oxygen and basic airway adjuncts.\ne. Advanced airway placement only when BVM ventilation ineffective or other\nconditions warrant advanced airway (e.g., long transport time) refer to 7.9\nAirway Management-Procedure Protocol\n4. Manage Ventilation (Prevent Hyperventilation)\nNote:  Identify and treat hypoventilation as well as prevent hyperventilation when\nassisting ventilation.  As much as possible maintain normal ventilation.  Hyper-\nventilation decreases cerebral blood flow and worsens secondary brain injury.\nStrict attention on avoiding hypo- and hyper- ventilation is critical. It has been\nshown that repeatedly that inadvertent hyperventilation happens reliably if not\nmeticulously prevented.  Use Pressure-Controlled Bags (PCBs) and Ventilation",

AIRWAY - Rapid establishment of an advanced airway with 100% oxygen\nadministration refer to 7.9 Airway Management-Procedure Protocol\nd.  CHEST DECOMPRESSION - Refer to 7.18 Pleural Decompression-\nProcedure Protocol.\ni.  Consider bilateral needle decompression in the presence of chest\ntrauma, regardless of findings.\ne.  HEMORRHAGE CONTROL - Bleeding control is essential refer to 2.13\nBleeding Control (BCON)-Treatment Protocol and if applicable 7.22\nTourniquet Application-Procedure Protocol.\ni.  Penetrating Trauma - Areas not amenable to tourniquet should have a\npressure dressing and/or wound packing per 2.13 Bleeding Control\n(BCON)-Procedure Protocol.\nii.  Blunt Trauma \u2013 Place a pelvic binder (commercial or a sheet) on all\npatients with blunt or blast trauma suffering traumatic arrest.

The primary purpose is protection of the patient from further harm. Do not\nconfront the patient or family members with such suspicions at the scene.\nMichigan law (MCL 722.623) requires that licensed EMS providers who have \u201creasonable\ncause to suspect child abuse or neglect\u201d shall report \u201cimmediately, by telephone or\notherwise\u201d their suspicions to the Protective Services Agency for the County involved. In\ncases of suspected child abuse, this oral report shall also be followed with a written report\non the Department of Human Services forms available in every hospital emergency\ndepartment.\nMichigan law (MCL 400.11a) also requires this same oral report for suspected cases of\nabuse or neglect of an adult.\nLicensed providers are required to make an immediate verbal report and a written report\nwithin 72 hours when they suspect child abuse or neglect. Mandated reporters must also\nnotify the head of their organization of the report. Reporting the suspected allegations of\nchild abuse and/or neglect to the head of the organization does not fulfill the requirement to\nreport directly to MDHHS.\nThe verbal report can be completed by calling 855-444-3911.

An amputation with hemorrhage does not\nnecessitate the use of a tourniquet; most bleeding from these injuries is controllable\nthrough use of direct pressure and elevation.\n2.  Amputation with uncontrolled active bleeding.\n3.  A mass causality incident may be an indication for the use of tourniquets for\ntemporary control of hemorrhage while the situation is brought under control.\nContraindications:\n1.  Never use a tourniquet for more than the recommended period of time (product-\nspecific).  With any extrication plus transport time of less than 180 minutes, there is\nminimal risk of developing an ischemic limb.\n2.  Never apply a tourniquet over an impaled object.\nProcedure:\n1.  If possible, check neurovascular status prior to tourniquet application (pulse,\nsensation, motor function distal to hemorrhage).\n2.  Apply tourniquet directly to the skin, proximal to the area of bleeding, at least 2-3\ninches (5-8 centimeters) from the wound margins.\n3.  Secure the tourniquet in place; continue to tighten the tourniquet until arterial\nocclusion (bleeding stops).\n4.  A successfully placed tourniquet may cause significant pain. (Refer to 7.13 Pain\nManagement-Procedure Protocol).\n5.  Document the time the tourniquet was applied.\n6.  Note  neurovascular status every five minutes post application.\n7.  Notify the receiving hospital that a tourniquet is in place.\n8.  Do not adjust or remove a tourniquet once bleeding is controlled.\n9.  A second tourniquet adjacent to the first may be necessary.\nNotes:\n1.  Tourniquets should not be applied over joints.  Application over the peroneal nerve\n(knee or ankle) or ulnar nerve (the elbow) may result in nerve damage or paralysis.\n2.  Any limb with an applied tourniquet should be fully exposed and the tourniquet should\nnot be covered with any other bandage.\n3.  Continued bleeding (other than medullary oozing from fractured bones) distal to the\nsite of the tourniquet is a sign of insufficient pressure and a need to tighten the\ntourniquet further.  A second tourniquet adjacent to the first may be necessary.  Refer\nto 2.13 Bleeding Control-Treatment Protocol.\n4.
